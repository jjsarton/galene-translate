# Help Tools

These very simple C programs can run on Linus and MacOS systems. Compiling them is as simple as calling
```make extract```, ```make merge``` and ```buildTemplate```.

While developing the translation scripts, I worked with my German translation. I have tried to get all possible textes provided by Gal√®nem there are a lot of textes and it is not possible to extract all of them manually.

In order to provide a template file and possibly have a multi translation via a translation system like DeepL, it will be nice to be able to have independent text files.

## Example:

```
tools/extract translation-de.js en.txt
``

This will provide the English text to be translated. For example, create a file pt.txt containing the Portuguese texts.

You can output the following after the work is done:

```
tools/merge template.txt pt.txt translation-pt.js
```

This creates translation-pt.js.

If you have translated the textes with a AI-system, revise the textes which may contain escaped characters as '"', '(' or ')'.

The translated textes shall contain '"', they must be escaped if there are no special charaters and  

## The buildTemplate command allows me to rebuild the template file from my translated text:

```
tools/buildTemplate translation-de.js template.txt
``
